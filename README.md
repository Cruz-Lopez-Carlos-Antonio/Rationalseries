# Rationalseries
The following Python code is an advanced (but more demanding) version of the code that was developed in the article "On the Generalized Summation of Series with Rational Coefficients", recently submited to Computer Physics Communications.

Esta es la serie que estamos evaluando:

<pre> ``` \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k^5 + k^4 + k^3 + k^2 + k + 1}{(k+1)^4 (k+2)^3 (k+3)^2} ``` </pre>
